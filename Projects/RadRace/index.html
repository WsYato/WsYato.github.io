                    This game was made to encourage elderly to fitness. The idea is that you would ride a fitness bike and that would be displayed
                    in an app on the mobile. it also was online, that way you could race againest other people. It used a couple of Arduinos
                    and some sensors to use detect movement in the fitness bike and send it to the game. A total of 8 people were working on this project.
                    2 artists and 6 programmers.

                    In this project I worked on the sensor part with a classmate. It was my first time using C, so in the beginning I had to grow accustomed to it.
                    It was a very steep learning curve but I enjoyed a lot. Afterwards I began working on the arduino part which to be honest wasn't a very pleasant
                    experience. The text editor was annoying which slowed down my work speed a lot. In the end me and the other classmate, which was also working
                    on the Arduino, pulled through and had everything working. But the game wasn't done yet. I then had received the task of working on the game
                    in unity. In there I mostly did UI stuff. The experience I gained from this project was the most valuable out of any other project. Mostly
                    because of the new programming language that I learned which was C.
