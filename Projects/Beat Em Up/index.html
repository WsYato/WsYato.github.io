                    This is a beat 'em up type game. The goal is to kill enemies, level up and finally kill the boss.
                    The game is made in unity and uses mostly unity built-in APIs.

                    This game is my first experience working on a game with a team. The art is all made by a group of
                    artists and the game logic is
                    made by me and a classmate. In this project I had already gained a lot of experience and knowledge
                    which I made use of in this project.
                    Mostly all the code used in this project is code that I am proud of and code that I would still
                    write today. What I learned from this project
                    was mostly unity stuff, but the most important thing was teamwork. It was the first time we pushed
                    our code, and backed it up online, so naturally
                    we had a lot of problems. But it was all very valuable experience and this project is one I'm
                    certainly proud of.
