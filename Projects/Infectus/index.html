                    This is a horror type multi-player FPS game. You are a special ops agent and your goal is to free a poisenous area that has been overrun by monsters.
                    This game was made in Unreal engine.

                    We started off this project with 6 members me included. 3 developers and 3 artists. At this point we were fairly good at what we're doing,
                    but we had no prior experience with Unreal Engine, so we spent the first few weeks understanding Unreal Engine and getting accustomed to it.
                    Afterwards we began planning the whole game. We progressed fast and got things going quickly. It is a cool project, and I'm very proud of it.
                    I mainly developed the guns, power ups and UI.
